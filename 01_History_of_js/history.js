// What are these?

// ECMA Script
// JavaScript is a programming language that was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape. It was originally called Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript. The name change was part of a marketing strategy to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.

// JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It is widely used for client-side web development, allowing developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, with the introduction of various frameworks and libraries that enhance its capabilities.

// JavaScript is standardized under the ECMAScript specification, which is maintained by ECMA International. The first edition of ECMAScript was published in 1997, and it has since undergone several revisions, with ECMAScript 6 (ES6) being one of the most significant updates, introducing many new features and improvements to the language.

// JavaScript is now a versatile language that can be used for both front-end and back-end development, thanks to environments like Node.js. It has become an essential part of modern web development, enabling developers to create rich, interactive applications that run in web browsers and on servers. Its popularity continues to grow, making it one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

// JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web applications. It allows developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, and perform asynchronous operations, making it a powerful tool for building modern web applications.

// JavaScript is also used in various other contexts, such as server-side development with Node.js, mobile app development with frameworks like React Native, and even in desktop applications using Electron. Its versatility and ease of use have contributed to its widespread adoption across different domains of software development.
